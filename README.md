# FinPort-Lending-Strategy
FinPort is a mid-sized consumer lending portfolio manager, with one big question on the table: Should we buy a peer portfolio OR allocate more capital to originations? Let's explore!
I built a full data-driven portfolio valuation and risk assessment pipeline, including:
* Portfolio Profitability Metrics — NIM, charge-off rate, net interest income
* Portfolio Valuation — DCF model of expected cashflows
* Risk & Uncertainty Assessment — Monte Carlo simulation under varying default & interest scenarios
* Forecasting — SARIMA & regression models to predict monthly default rates and net interest income

But first — Exploratory Data Analysis gave us key insights:

✅ Highest Default Rate: 6.9% in March 2018
✅ Consistent Improvement: Mean default rate dropped from 4.3% in 2018 ➝ 0.5% in 2023
✅ Visuals: Monthly and annual trend charts clearly showed a sharp decline in defaults over time

📉 What This Means:
The portfolio is performing much better today thanks to stronger credit risk management and collections. But…

⚠️ Key Watchpoints:

Early warning indicators are critical — 2018-level spikes must never catch us off-guard again

Even 0.5% default can erode margins — recovery strategies can be strengthened

Stress testing & diversification remain essential to prepare for macroeconomic shocks

🔑 Takeaway:
Good metrics are worth celebrating — but they are also an opportunity to ask, how do we make sure we stay ahead of risk?

Data-driven strategy isn’t just about understanding the past — it’s about positioning the organization for future growth and resilience.
